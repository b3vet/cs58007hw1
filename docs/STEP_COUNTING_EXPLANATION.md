## Signal Processing Techniques Used

### 1. **Low-Pass Filtering**

Two types of low-pass filters are implemented **without using scipy**:

#### A. Exponential Smoothing (IIR Filter)
```python
def lowpass_filter_exponential(signal, cutoff_hz, sampling_rate):
    alpha = np.exp(-2.0 * np.pi * cutoff_hz / sampling_rate)
    filtered[i] = alpha * filtered[i-1] + (1 - alpha) * signal[i]
```

- **Purpose**: Remove high-frequency noise and estimate gravity component
- **Cutoff frequency**: 0.3 Hz (separates gravity from linear acceleration)
- **Type**: First-order IIR (Infinite Impulse Response)
- **Advantage**: Computationally efficient, only needs previous output

#### B. Moving Average (Convolution)
```python
def lowpass_filter_moving_average(signal, window_size):
    kernel = np.ones(window_size) / window_size
    filtered = np.convolve(signal, kernel, mode='same')
```

- **Purpose**: Smooth the magnitude signal to reduce noise
- **Window size**: ~50ms (5 samples at 100 Hz)
- **Type**: FIR filter using convolution with box kernel
- **Advantage**: Simple, linear phase, easy to understand

**Why Low-Pass Filtering?**
- Walking motion is in the 1-2 Hz range
- Sensor noise is at higher frequencies (>10 Hz)
- Gravity is constant (0 Hz) or very low frequency
- Filtering removes noise while preserving step information

---

### 2. **Gravity Removal**

```python
def remove_gravity(ax, ay, az, cutoff_hz=0.3, sampling_rate):
    # Gravity = low-frequency component
    gx = lowpass_filter_exponential(ax, cutoff_hz, sampling_rate)
    gy = lowpass_filter_exponential(ay, cutoff_hz, sampling_rate)
    gz = lowpass_filter_exponential(az, cutoff_hz, sampling_rate)

    # Linear acceleration = total - gravity
    lx = ax - gx
    ly = ay - gy
    lz = az - gz
```

**Why Remove Gravity?**
- Accelerometer measures **total acceleration = gravity + linear acceleration**
- Gravity is ~9.8 m/s² pointing downward (dominates the signal)
- Phone orientation changes during walking, making gravity direction vary
- Removing gravity isolates the motion we care about (steps)

**How It Works:**
- Gravity changes slowly (low frequency)
- Linear acceleration from steps is faster (higher frequency)
- Low-pass filter extracts gravity
- Subtract to get linear acceleration

---

### 3. **Magnitude Calculation**

```python
def compute_magnitude(x, y, z):
    return np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)
```

**Why Use Magnitude?**
- Makes the signal **orientation-independent**
- Phone can be held at any angle
- Magnitude captures total movement regardless of direction
- Simplifies from 3D to 1D problem

**Physical Meaning:**
- Magnitude represents the **intensity of acceleration**
- Each step creates a characteristic "spike" in magnitude
- Walking pattern becomes clear periodic peaks

---

## Step Counting Methods

### **Method 1: Peak Detection** (Primary Method)

**Algorithm:**
```python
1. Remove gravity from X, Y, Z axes
2. Compute magnitude of linear acceleration
3. Smooth magnitude with moving average
4. Calculate adaptive threshold = mean + 0.3 * std
5. Detect peaks above threshold
6. Enforce minimum distance between peaks (0.3s)
```

**Features Used:**
- **Magnitude**: Captures overall motion intensity
- **Peaks**: Each step creates a local maximum
- **Adaptive threshold**: Adjusts to walking intensity
- **Minimum distance**: Prevents double-counting

**Why This Works:**
- Each foot strike creates an acceleration spike
- Peaks are regularly spaced (~0.5-1 second apart)
- Threshold eliminates noise while keeping steps

**Results:**
- Walking Trial 1: **35 steps** (98.4 steps/min)
- Walking Trial 2: **41 steps** (115.6 steps/min)

---

### **Method 2: Autocorrelation** (Periodicity Detection)

**Algorithm:**
```python
1. Compute magnitude of linear acceleration
2. Normalize signal (zero mean, unit variance)
3. Calculate autocorrelation (signal convolved with itself)
4. Find peak in autocorrelation between 0.3-2.0 seconds
5. Peak location = step period
6. Steps = duration / period
```

**Features Used:**
- **Periodicity**: Walking is rhythmic
- **Autocorrelation**: Measures similarity at different time lags
- **Peak lag**: Reveals dominant period

**Why This Works:**
- Walking creates repeating pattern
- Autocorrelation finds how long until pattern repeats
- Peak at lag τ means signal repeats every τ seconds

**Limitation:**
- Assumes perfectly regular walking
- Sensitive to pace changes
- Results: **16 steps** (underestimates due to pace variation)

**Mathematical Basis:**
- Autocorrelation R(τ) = ∫ signal(t) × signal(t+τ) dt
- Periodic signals have peaks at multiples of period
- Implemented via convolution: `np.correlate(signal, signal)`

---

### **Method 3: Zero-Crossing Rate**

**Algorithm:**
```python
1. Compute magnitude of linear acceleration
2. Remove DC offset (subtract mean)
3. Smooth signal
4. Count zero crossings (sign changes)
5. Estimate: step_frequency = zero_crossings / (2 × duration)
```

**Features Used:**
- **Zero crossings**: Points where signal changes sign
- **Crossing rate**: Indicates oscillation frequency
- **Sign changes**: Detect with `np.diff(np.sign(signal))`

**Why This Works:**
- Each step cycle: acceleration goes positive → negative → positive
- Creates ~2 zero crossings per step
- Zero crossing rate ∝ step frequency

**Limitation:**
- Overestimates due to noise-induced crossings
- Smoothing reduces but doesn't eliminate this
- Results: **53 steps** (overestimates)

**Implementation (No scipy required):**
```python
def count_zero_crossings(signal):
    signs = np.sign(signal)
    zero_crossings = np.where(np.diff(signs) != 0)[0]
    return len(zero_crossings)
```

---

### **Combined Method** (Robust Estimate)

**Algorithm:**
```python
1. Run all three methods
2. Take median of results
3. Median is robust to outliers
```

**Results:**
- Method 1: 35 steps ✓
- Method 2: 16 steps (underestimate)
- Method 3: 53 steps (overestimate)
- **Median: 35 steps** ✓

**Why Median?**
- Robust to individual method failures
- Less sensitive to outliers than mean
- Works well when one method is primary (peak detection)

## Key Features for Step Counting

### 1. **Magnitude** (Most Important)
- **Definition**: √(x² + y² + z²)
- **Range during walking**: 0.5 - 2.5 m/s²
- **Pattern**: Regular peaks, one per step
- **Advantage**: Orientation-independent

### 2. **Peaks**
- **Definition**: Local maxima in smoothed magnitude
- **Characteristics**:
  - Height > threshold
  - Separated by min distance (0.3s)
  - Correspond to foot strikes
- **Detection**: Compare each point with neighbors

### 3. **Zero Crossings**
- **Definition**: Points where signal crosses zero
- **Pattern**: 2 crossings per step cycle
- **Use**: Estimate step frequency

### 4. **Threshold (Adaptive)**
- **Formula**: threshold = mean + k × std
- **Typical k**: 0.25 - 0.3
- **Purpose**: Separate steps from noise
- **Adaptive**: Adjusts to walking intensity

### 5. **Temporal Constraints**
- **Minimum step period**: 0.33s (max 3 steps/sec)
- **Maximum step period**: 1.33s (min 0.75 steps/sec)
- **Purpose**: Prevent false detections
- **Basis**: Human walking physiology
