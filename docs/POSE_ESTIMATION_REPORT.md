## Issues Found in Original Implementation

### üî¥ Critical Issue #1: Swapped Pitch/Roll Formulas

**Original Code (WRONG):**
```python
# Line 34-35 in pose_estimation.py
pitch_acc = math.degrees(math.atan2(ay[i], math.sqrt(ax[i]**2 + az[i]**2)))   # WRONG!
roll_acc  = math.degrees(math.atan2(-ax[i], math.sqrt(ay[i]**2 + az[i]**2)))  # WRONG!
```

**Problem**: These formulas are literally swapped! The variable called "pitch" actually calculates roll, and vice versa.

**Corrected Code:**
```python
# Fixed in pose_estimation_improved.py
pitch_acc = math.degrees(math.atan2(-ax[i], math.sqrt(ay[i]**2 + az[i]**2)))  # CORRECT
roll_acc  = math.degrees(math.atan2(ay[i], math.sqrt(ax[i]**2 + az[i]**2)))   # CORRECT
```

**Explanation:**
- **Pitch** = rotation around Y-axis (tilting forward/backward)
  - When you tilt forward, X-axis acceleration changes
  - Formula: `atan2(-ax, sqrt(ay¬≤ + az¬≤))`

- **Roll** = rotation around X-axis (tilting left/right)
  - When you tilt sideways, Y-axis acceleration changes
  - Formula: `atan2(ay, sqrt(ax¬≤ + az¬≤))`

**Impact**: All reported angles were backwards! Pitch was roll, roll was pitch.

### üü° Issue #2: Fixed Time Step (dt)

**Original Code:**
```python
fs = 1/np.median(np.diff(t))
dt = 1/fs  # Fixed dt for entire recording
```

**Problem**: Uses average dt for all samples, but actual timestamps vary slightly.

**Improved Code:**
```python
for i in range(len(t)):
    if i == 0:
        dt = 1.0 / fs  # First sample
    else:
        dt = t[i] - t[i-1]  # Actual time difference
```

**Impact**: More accurate angle integration, especially if sampling rate varies.

---

### üü° Issue #3: No Gyroscope Bias Correction

**Problem**: Gyroscopes have a constant bias (offset) that causes drift over time.

**Added Solution:**
```python
def estimate_gyro_bias(gx, gy, gz, initial_samples=100):
    """Estimate bias from initial stationary period"""
    n = min(initial_samples, len(gx))
    bias_x = np.mean(gx[:n])
    bias_y = np.mean(gy[:n])
    bias_z = np.mean(gz[:n])
    return bias_x, bias_y, bias_z
```

**Example from walking data:**
```
Gyroscope bias removed: X=-0.0320, Y=0.0760, Z=0.1807 rad/s
```

**Impact**: Reduces drift in integrated angles, especially for yaw.

---

### üü¢ Issue #4: Noisy Accelerometer Data

**Added**: Optional low-pass filtering for accelerometer

```python
def low_pass_filter(signal, alpha=0.9):
    """Exponential smoothing to reduce noise"""
    filtered[i] = alpha * filtered[i-1] + (1 - alpha) * signal[i]
```

**Impact**: Smoother angle estimates, especially visible in the plots (orange line vs blue line).

---

## What the Complementary Filter Does

### The Problem:

1. **Accelerometer alone**:
   - ‚úÖ No drift (measures gravity)
   - ‚ùå Very noisy (sensor noise, vibrations)
   - ‚ùå Cannot measure yaw (gravity doesn't change with yaw)

2. **Gyroscope alone**:
   - ‚úÖ Smooth, no noise
   - ‚ùå Drifts over time (integration error accumulates)
   - ‚úÖ Can measure all three axes

### The Solution: Complementary Filter

Combine both sensors to get the best of both worlds!

```python
# Œ± ‚âà 0.98 means:
# - Trust gyroscope 98% (short-term accuracy)
# - Trust accelerometer 2% (long-term correction)

angle = Œ± √ó angle_gyro + (1-Œ±) √ó angle_accel
```

**Why it works:**
- **High frequency** (fast changes): Gyro is accurate, accel is noisy ‚Üí Trust gyro
- **Low frequency** (slow drift): Gyro drifts, accel is accurate ‚Üí Trust accel
- Œ± = 0.98 is the "crossover frequency" that separates high/low frequency

## Results: Walking Analysis

### Walking Trial 1 (21.34 seconds):

```
Pitch statistics:
  Mean: -4.02¬∞     (slight forward tilt while walking)
  Std:  8.91¬∞      (variation due to walking motion)
  Range: 39.35¬∞    (-22.76¬∞ to 16.59¬∞)

Roll statistics:
  Mean: -1.03¬∞     (nearly level left/right)
  Std:  12.05¬∞     (larger variation - arm swing)
  Range: 75.86¬∞    (-51.71¬∞ to 24.16¬∞)

Yaw: -155.63¬∞      (DRIFTS - no magnetometer!)
```

### Observations from Plots:

1. **Pitch (Forward/Backward Tilt)**:
   - Blue line (accel-only): Very noisy, spikes ¬±80¬∞
   - Orange line (filtered): Smooth, oscillates ¬±20¬∞
   - Pattern: Regular oscillations due to walking gait
   - ‚úÖ Complementary filter works perfectly

2. **Roll (Left/Right Tilt)**:
   - Blue line: Extremely noisy, spikes ¬±90¬∞
   - Orange line: Smooth, oscillates ¬±20¬∞
   - Larger variation than pitch (arm swing during walking)
   - Clear periodic pattern matching step cadence
   - ‚úÖ Filter removes noise effectively

3. **Yaw (Rotation)**:
   - Steadily drifts from 0¬∞ to -155¬∞ over 21 seconds
   - ‚ùå This is expected - no magnetometer to correct drift
   - Shows gyroscope integration error
   - Drift rate: ~7.3¬∞/second

4. **Combined Plot**:
   - Both pitch and roll oscillate during walking
   - Frequency matches step cadence (~1.5 Hz)
   - Filtered signals are smooth and believable

## Results: Sitting Analysis

### Sitting (Stationary, 10.92 seconds):

**Key Observations:**

1. **Pitch**:
   - Starts at ~8¬∞, gradually drifts to ~-20¬∞
   - Less variation than walking (sitting is more stable)
   - Some noise from hand movements

2. **Roll**:
   - Remains fairly stable around 0-5¬∞
   - Minimal variation (phone held steady)

3. **Yaw**:
   - Very small drift (~1.4¬∞ over 10 seconds)
   - Much better than walking! (less movement = less bias error)

4. **Comparison to Walking**:
   - **Much lower variation** (expected - sitting is static)
   - **Less noise** (no periodic motion)
   - ‚úÖ Successfully distinguishes sitting from walking

## Validation: Does it Make Sense?

### ‚úÖ Pitch and Roll Behave Correctly:

**Walking:**
- Large oscillations (¬±20¬∞) ‚Üí ‚úÖ Correct (arm swings, body motion)
- Periodic pattern ‚Üí ‚úÖ Correct (matches walking cadence)
- Roll > Pitch variation ‚Üí ‚úÖ Correct (arm swing is side-to-side)

**Sitting:**
- Small variations (¬±5¬∞) ‚Üí ‚úÖ Correct (minor hand movements)
- Gradual drift ‚Üí ‚úÖ Correct (person adjusts posture)
- Roll ‚âà 0¬∞ ‚Üí ‚úÖ Correct (phone held upright)

### ‚ùå Yaw Drifts (Expected):

Without magnetometer:
- **Walking**: -155¬∞ drift over 21s ‚Üí ‚ùå Unusable for absolute heading
- **Sitting**: ~1¬∞ drift over 11s ‚Üí ‚ùå Still drifts, but slower

**Conclusion**: Yaw requires magnetometer for absolute orientation. Current implementation shows relative rotation only.

## Axis Convention

```
iPhone in hand (portrait mode):

         Y (points up)
         |
         |
    +----+---- X (points right)
   /
  /
 Z (points out of screen toward you)
```

**Rotations:**
- **Pitch**: Around Y-axis (X changes) - Nod forward/backward
- **Roll**: Around X-axis (Y changes) - Tilt left/right
- **Yaw**: Around Z-axis (Z always ~9.8) - Rotate on table

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations:

1. **No Absolute Yaw**:
   - Gyroscope-only yaw drifts continuously
   - **Solution**: Add magnetometer for absolute heading
   - **Alternative**: Accept relative yaw only

2. **Assumes Stationary Start**:
   - Bias estimation requires initial stationary period
   - **Solution**: More sophisticated bias estimation

3. **No Position Tracking**:
   - Only orientation, not location
   - **Solution**: Add double integration (very error-prone)

### Possible Enhancements:

1. **Madgwick or Mahony Filter**:
   - More sophisticated than complementary filter
   - Handles all edge cases better
   - Requires quaternion math

2. **Kalman Filter**:
   - Optimal fusion of accel + gyro
   - Handles noise statistics properly
   - More complex to implement

3. **Activity-Specific Tuning**:
   - Different Œ± for walking vs sitting
   - Adaptive filtering based on motion

4. **Quaternion Representation**:
   - Avoids gimbal lock
   - More accurate for large rotations
   - Required for full 3D orientation
